# baking-shows

My sophomore year of college, I lost my hearing and came down with a sudden illness that kept me from my classes, my jobs, and my collegiate soccer season. I did not step outside of my dorm building for almost a month, and had little strength to keep in touch with my friends and family, and I certainly was not able to attend my classes or practices as they both went on without me.

Not that I was concerned about how I was spending my time (most of it -- if not all -- was spent in bed recovering), but while I toughed out my sickness I realized that I had been grounding myself with <i>The Great British Baking Show</i> in the background of my illness. Running on loop for hours and days on end, this particular Netflix show was something that brought me a sense of both consistency and joy, even if I could not hear it. After recovering, I returned to the classroom to finish the semester off with a 4.0, to the pitch to finish up my second season of soccer, and to my on-campus jobs to make an impact on the lives of current and prospect students. And, of course, I explored other baking shows on Netflix and then created this website in dedication of that tough time.

In the meantime, I am currently completing an internship with the Farm Credit Administration while living in Capitol Hill, DC. Updates to this website will be completed when I have spare time outside of this opportunity! Enjoy.
